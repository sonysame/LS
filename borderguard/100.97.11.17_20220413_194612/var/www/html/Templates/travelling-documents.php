<h1>Travel documents for EU countries</h1>

<p>As <strong>EU national country member citizen</strong>, <strong>you do not need to show your national ID card or passport</strong> when you are travelling from one border-free Schengen EU country to another.</p>
<p>Even if you don't need a passport for border checks within the Schengen area , it is still always <strong>highly recommended to take a passport or ID card with you</strong>,
 so you can prove your identity if needed (if stopped by police, boarding a plane, etc.). Schengen EU countries have the possibility of adopting national rules obliging you to hold 
 or carry papers and documents when you are present on their territory.</p>
<p>Driving licences, post, bank or tax cards are not accepted as valid travel documents or proof of identity.</p>

<p>Under Schengen rules, in <strong>extenuating circumstances</strong>, where a threat to public policy or national security has been identified Member States are permitted to reintroduce <strong>temporary border controls</strong>.</p>
More detailed information and the list of countries which have temporarily reintroduced border controls.  Ensure that you have either your ID or passport in your possession when travelling to these countries.  Also bear in mind that even under normal circumstances you may be required to produce one of these documents.

<h2>Entry refusal</h2>
<p>In very rare cases, an EU country can refuse entry to you or your family members for reasons of " public policy, public security or public health".
This means the authorities must prove you or your family members pose a " genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat".
You are entitled to receive this decision in writing, stating all the grounds, and specifying how you can appeal and by when.
<p>If you know you have trouble with your Passports (expired document etc..) you can set an <a href='/appointment'>appointment</a> in order to renew it and travel secure.
